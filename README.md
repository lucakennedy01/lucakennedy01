Hi, thanks for checking out my profile, I use this account for storing projects you might be interested in that reflect my software interests such as:
-Machine learning
-Big data
-Data analysis and representation
-Personal tools (Resistor NPV calculator featured by repl.it!)
-Learning new languages

I'm always looking to collaborate on just about anything python/C/C++/JavaScript!
